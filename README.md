A quick install of Gatsby that uses Markdown and supports images in posts. [Gatsby starter default](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default) was used, and the `index.js` was changed to query the posts and show a [list of post links](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-a-list-of-markdown-blog-posts). Check the commit history for all the steps.

1. `npm i`
2. `gatsby develop`
